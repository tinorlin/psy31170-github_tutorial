* Why this class?
Tech for Psychology is my first tech class. I'm interested in this class because I want to aquire new hard skills and become 
 exposed to the world of data and analytics. I've always been very interested in to learn how to create a website!

* what on the syllabus scares you? 
The language. I'm a novice to the world of coding, the terminology scares me; especially the projects! I hope I'm able to connect the pieces 
 and be able to create my own project successfully. 

* What stories do you want to tell? 
I'm interested in the psychology behid who idividuas aquire character, and their sub-cultures. I think it's really interesting
how diiferently people engage with each other, why some people are more assertive than others, and their family structures and belief systmes. 
I think it's a fascnating phenomenon, especially because we live and share a world where the only reality that exist is your own.
