* why this class? 
     I want to learn programming that will be relevant to me as a Psychology major. I want to be able to apply knowledge learned from this class in real settings such as workplace, research etc. I want to master the content learned in this class.

* what on the syllabus scares you?
     Nothing really, I am just keen to learn something new and useful. I am glad about the fact that we don't have any exams.

* What questions do you have about the syllabus? 
     I just feel that having clear guidelines on completing the project will be helpful. Will we be able to pace our project and work towards the project one step at a time?


* What stories do you want to tell? 
     I am just a simple person working towards a life of freedom and dignity.
