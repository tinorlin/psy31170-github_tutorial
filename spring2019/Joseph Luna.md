* why this class?
I was a computer engineer major my first year since I always wanted to code but did poorly. I would like to try again and hopefully spark my interest again

* what on the syllabus scares you?
The Projects since I'm not sure what to expect yet

* what questions do you have about the syllabus 
How lengthy are the homeworks 

* what stories do you want to share?
My first coding class I failed all 4 assignments with raw scores of 1/12 each so that's currently my skill cap. I'm more involved with psychology
