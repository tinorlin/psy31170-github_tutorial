* What stories do you want to tell?

I dont have many stories to tell.

* Why this class?

I chose this class because I thought it would be interesting to learn something I have not had experience with before, I also want to challenge myself with coding and attempting to learn it.

* What on the syllabus scares you?

What scares me most on the syllabus is all of the coding terms that I do not yet know.

* What questions do you have about the syllabus?

The syllabus is pretty clear on the course expectations. I dont have any questions about it.
