* Why this class?

I'm taking this class because I plan on going to grad school for a PhD in Clinical Psychology, and I thought it would be beneficial to learn about programming data.

* What on the syllabus scares you?

I'm new to programming, so words like "numpy, pandas, geopandas, nltk, beautifulsoup, requests, etc" scare me because they sound like normal words, but probably mean something way more complex.

* What questions do you have about the syllabus?

Are work and readings due the day announced on syllabus or the week after? E.g. Is HW #2 due Feb 22 or Mar 1? And is it the same for readings? Would the TCS chapers on that day be due for Feb 22's class or the week after?

* What stories do you want to tell?

I want to work as a research psychologist to develop a better understanding of Borderline Personality Disorder as it holds a lot of sigma which leads to mental health workers refusing to treat them at times. I want to develop a better understanding behind BPD triggers, emotional regulation, and suicidality, along with its comorbity with Bipolar Disorder, ADHD, and Anxiety.
